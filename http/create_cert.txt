*Create your Private key with a password

openssl genrsa -des3 -out domain.tld.encrypted.key 1024

*Create your Private key without a password

openssl genrsa -out domain.tld.key 1024
If you created your private key with a password, you’ll want to complete the rest of the steps using a decrypted private key - else you’ll have to type in your password every time you use the certificate (ie: every time you start a daemon using that certificate.)

*Remove the password and encryption from your private key

openssl rsa -in domain.tld.encrypted.key -out domain.tld.key

**Step Two: Create a CSR

On this step you’re going to create what you send to your Certificate Authority. If you set a password with your Private Key, you’ll enter it to create the CSR. After you finish all these steps, you can delete your CSR.

*Create your Certificate Signing Request

openssl req -new -key domain.tld.key -out domain.tld.csr

*Step Three: Create your Certificate

You have three options here: 1. Self-signing - Easy, free, and quick. Not trusted by browsers. 2. Creating a certificate authority (CA) - Not difficult, but likely more effort. Still isn’t trusted by browsers. 3. Paying a CA to create your certificate for you. Can be cheap ($20), pretty easy, and is trusted by browsers.

My advice: Self-sign your certificates for personal things, and pay for a certificate if its public and important.

If you’d like to pay for someone to sign your certificates, do some research and find which one you want to use. Next, find their instructions for submitting your CSR file.

*Self-Sign your Certificate

openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in domain.tld.csr -signkey domain.tld.key -out domain.tld.crt
If you do happen to want to setup your own certificate authority, check these resources out:

Step Four: Creating a PEM file

Many daemons use a PEM file. Directions on how to generate such a PEM file can be hard to come by. I have had pretty good success with combining the .key and the .crt file together:

cat domain.tld.key domain.tld.crt > domain.tld.pem
